# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this task.

## Objective
The objective is to develop a decision tree classifier that accurately predicts customer purchasing behavior. The model is trained using two different criteria: Gini impurity and Entropy, to compare their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Training the decision tree classifier using Gini impurity and Entropy.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Comparison**: Comparing the results from both criteria.

## Results
The results show that the decision tree classifier trained with [Gini/Entropy] performed better in terms of [specific metrics].

## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Use the provided Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
